# 8x8 2D-DCT
This repository contains the Verilog HDL implementation for a high-performance 8x8 Forward 2D Discrete Cosine Transform (2D-DCT) core design. The design utilizes the Row-Column Decomposition method and is specifically verified for functionality and precision using the classic 256x256 grayscale Lena image data.
